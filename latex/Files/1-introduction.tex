\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
\label{subsect:purpose}

This section should include the goals.

This document represents the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD). Goals of this document are to completely describe the system in terms of functional and non-functional requirements, analyze the real needs of the customer in order to model the system, show the constraints and the limit of the software and indicate the typical use cases that will occur after the release. This document is addressed to the developers who have to implement the requirements and could be used as a contractual basis

\subsection{Scope}
\label{subsect:scope}

Scope: here we include an analysis of the world and of the shared phenomena. Identifies the product and application domain.

\subsubsection{Description of the given problem}
\label{subsect:descriptionofthegivenproblem}

In these trying times of global pandemic, such as a common matter as going grocery shopping has become a relevant threat for the general public health. In spite of this situation, grocery shopping still remains an essential need which has to be carried out: being so, avoiding crowding up either inside and outnside of grocery shops in order to avoid any source of hazards becomes the new main issue to focus on.\ CLup is a new software application that proposes itself to help either the grocery shop owners to adequate to the new governamental rules and grocery shop customers to protect their own health.\ Clup provides three main functionalities: a virtual queue, which has the conceptual purpose of substituing the physical lines outside of shops; a QR code identification system, which allows grocery shops managers to constantly monitor the influx of incoming people in the shop and, finally, the functionality of booking your grocery shop session on an online facility, this offers a further way to regulate people flow to shops managers and the possibility to better schedule their time to cutomers.

\subsubsection{Goals}
\label{subsect:goals}

Shop Manager:
[G1] Allow a manager to sign on the system
[G2] Allow a manager to sign in the system
[G3] Allow a manager to register their store/stores on the system
	[G.3.1]Allow a manager to divide their store in areas	
	[G.3.2]Allow a manager to register the items in the areas
	[G.3.3]Allow a manager to register the opening time of their 
		store
[G4] Allow a manager to make a customer join a virtual queue

Customers:
[G5]Allow a customer to join a virtual queue receiving a unique QR code for identifying themselves, whether registered or not
[G6]Allow a customer to receive push notifications to remind them to reach the store in time for their turn
[G7]Allow a customer to sign on the system
[G8]Allow a customer to sign in the system
[G9]Allow a customer to book a shopping session at a grocery store registered on the system
	[G9.1]Allow a customer to select categories of items they are 		intending to 
	buy
	[G9.2]Allow a customer to select the time and duration(between 		predefined options) for they session 	
[G10] Allow a customer to know the estimated time of a virtual queue before		joining it





\subsection{Phenomena}
\label{subsect:phenomena}

The machine: the portion of system to be developed.
The world (a.k.a. the environment): the portion of the real-world affected by the machine.
Requirements engineering is concerned with phenomena occurring in the world, as opposed to phenomena occurring inside the machine.

Goals are prescriptive assertions formulated in terms of \textbf{world} phenomena (not necessarily shared).

Domain properties/assumptions are descriptive assertions assumed to hold in the \textbf{world}.

Requirements are prescriptive assertions formulated in terms of \textbf{shared} phenomena.

Requirements are a bridge from the \textbf{machine} to the real \textbf{world}.

Find all the possible phenomena, than, for each one specify if its shared or not and who controls it (world or machine)

\subsubsection{World phenomena}
\label{subsubsect:worldphenomena}

World phenomena are phenomena that the machine can not observe.

\subsubsection{Shared Phenomena}
\label{subsubsect:sharedphenomena}

Some world phenomena are shared with the machine.
Shared phenomena can be controlled by the world and observed by the machine, or controlled by the machine andd observed by the world.
