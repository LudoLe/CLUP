\subsection{Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations}
\label{subsect:definitionsacronymsabbreviations}

With the term \textbf{queue}, a disambiguation is needed: here and in every other part of this document, we indicate a series of tickets in temporal order, either queue tickets or visit tickets. 

However, from time to time, the terms \textit{queue, dequeue, enqueuement, dequement} will be referred only to users who decide to line up in the \textbf{virtual queue}, intended as the one composed only of queue tickets. 

Even though it may seem confusing now, we have retained that the context will be enough of a disclaimer for the user to have clearly in mind which kind of queue we are talking about.

\noindent
The following table [\ref{table:acronyms}] shows all the acronyms used in the document.

%TODO: (lo scrivo qua anche se non Ã¨ il posto adatto...) dobbiamo parlare del fatto che i totem possono avere problemi di ritardo e che quindi serve uno schermetto.
